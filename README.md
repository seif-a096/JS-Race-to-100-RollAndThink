# ðŸŽ¯ JS-Race-to-100-RollAndThink

A fast-paced, two-player dice game built with vanilla JavaScript. Roll the dice, accumulate points, but donâ€™t get too greedy â€” if you roll a 1, you lose your turn! Be the first to reach 100 points by playing it smart.

## ðŸŽ² How to Play
- Roll the dice as many times as you like during your turn.
- Each roll adds to your **current score** â€” unless itâ€™s a **1**, which resets your turn!
- Click **"Hold"** to add the current score to your **total**.
- First player to reach **100** wins!
